To fix this, ensure that the `keyExtractor` prop is correctly set. This prop should return a unique key for each item in the data array. The key must be a string or number that uniquely identifies each item. If using unique IDs from an external source like a database, ensure these are correctly passed down. Here's a corrected example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Correct keyExtractor
/>
```
If you are not using unique IDs, you can use the index as a key, but this is not recommended for large datasets as it can cause performance issues. Using unique IDs from your data source ensures that the list renders efficiently and correctly.
